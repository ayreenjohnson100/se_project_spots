# Project 3: Spots

### Project Functionality's

- Structure of the page: in my project we duplicated figma structure and overview with using Html, Css, and Bem elements. To complete this I used figma to view how the layout was presented.

## Technologies

- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): Which is our standard and common way of structuring content and elements for a web pages.

- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): It's the style sheet language we use for describing the inner visuals of our web pages. CSS goes hand to hand with HTML.

- Responsive Design: Used for viewing and interacting with different devices such as, Desktop's, Phones, and Computers.

## Techniques

- Grid Systems: I used grid and column out the images for the correct structure. Worlks from the base of HTML.

- HTML: had to use proper html elements and tags to provide meaning and the structure of the content.

- CSS: Cascade of the CSS rules which ensures and helps maintain the style of the values.

  Here the image of the project that I have completed. I'll go over a element that help me accomplish this project might of gave others a hard time.

Plus New Post: [Image](./images/SS%20Plus-btn%20img.png): Clicking on the image you would see the button. For me to be able to separate the plus from new post I had to add a class within the img tag in html which is (profile add-plus) and CSS I added the margin-right 8 px to add space between the two. With out adding that class it would margin the entire whole button. Something you must watch out for.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

- [Link to the project on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/BBNm2bC3lj8QQMHlnqRsga/Sprint-3-Project-%E2%80%94-Spots?type=design&node-id=2%3A60&mode=design&t=afgNFybdorZO6cQo-1)

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
